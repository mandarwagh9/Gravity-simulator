# Gravity Simulator

## Overview

The Gravity Simulator is a web-based application that allows users to explore the effects of gravity on different objects by simulating their falls from a height. Users can select various objects and change the gravitational force based on the planet selected. The application visually demonstrates how gravity affects the motion of different objects, providing educational insights into physics.

## Features

- **Object Selection**: Choose from a variety of objects:
  - Ball
  - Chair
  - Car
  - Balloon
  - Stone

- **Planet Selection**: Select a planet to change the gravitational force:
  - Earth (9.8 m/s²)
  - Mars (3.7 m/s²)
  - Jupiter (24.8 m/s²)
  - Moon (1.6 m/s²)
  - Venus (8.87 m/s²)

- **Visual Representation**: Each object is represented by an image, enhancing the visual appeal of the simulation.

- **Max Height Display**: The application tracks and displays the maximum height reached by the object during its fall.

- **Interactive Controls**: Easily change the object and the planet to see how they behave under different gravitational conditions.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be user-friendly across different devices.

## Getting Started

To run the Gravity Simulator locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gravity-simulator.git
   cd gravity-simulator
   ```

2. **Prepare Object Images**:  
   Create a folder named `images` in the project directory and place the following images inside:
   - `ball.png`
   - `chair.png`
   - `car.png`
   - `balloon.png`
   - `stone.png`

   Ensure that these images have a transparent background for the best visual results.

3. **Open the Application**:  
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Select an object from the dropdown menu.
2. Choose a planet to change the gravitational force.
3. Watch as the object falls and see how high it bounces back.
4. The maximum height reached will be displayed on the screen.
